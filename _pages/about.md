![Illustration of LLM for Auto-building modeling](/images/graphic.png){: .align-right width="420px"}

👨🏻‍💻 I'm a third-year PhD candidate at The University of Utah, expecting to graduate in June 2026.

📍 My research interests:
  - 🤖 **AI & LLM for Building**
  - ⚙️ **Physics-Informed Modeling**
  - 🏙 **Building Energy Modeling & Calibration**.

📌 I'm currently developing **auto-building energy modeling (ABEM) using LLMs** to improve **modeling accessibility & scalability**.

## 🖇 Open-Source Contributions
[EPlus-LLM](https://github.com/EPlus-LLM/Model): A large-scale LLM for auto-building energy modeling.

[Prompting LLMs for ABEM](https://github.com/Gangjiang1/Prompting-for-Auto-building-Modeling): A comprehensive guideline for prompt engineering of LLMs in building modeling.

## 🔬 Experience
🧪 As part of my PhD journey, I am working with [Dr. Jianli Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y0ycryUAAAAJ&hl=en) on NSF-funded projects focused on Building Energy Modeling, Calibration, Optimization, and AI Applications in Buildings.

🧫 During my Master’s degree, I collaborated with [Dr. Zhe Tian](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhe-Tian-2) on NSF-China projects related to Building Energy System Simulation and Building Fault Detection & Diagnosis.

✍️ I have completed internships at [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), where I have gained experience in designing and operating data centers with a focus on enhancing resilience and scalability, and at [SUNAC](https://www.sunac.com.cn/en/about.aspx), where I worked in real estate management.
