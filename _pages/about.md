🧏🏻‍♂️ I'm a final-year PhD candidate at The University of Utah, expecting to graduate in June 2026, and **I'm open to work**.

🔬 My research interests lie in 🤖 **AI & LLM for Building**, ⚙️ **Physics-Informed Machine Learning**, and 🏙 **Building Energy Modeling & Calibration**.

📌 I'm currently developing **auto-building energy modeling using LLMs** to improve **modeling accessibility & scalability**.

## 🤖 Open-sourced Models and codes
[EPlus-LLM](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav): A large open-sourced LLM for auto-building energy modeling.

[Guidelines for prompting LLMs in building modeling](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench): A comprehensive test of LLMs in building modeling.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 News
Mar. 2024. Indianapolis, Indiana, I am a speaker at the ASHRAE annual conference. 
Mar. 2024. A new research paper, “xxx.” was published on Applied Energy.
