![Illustration of LLM for Auto-building modeling](/images/graphic.png){: .align-right width="400px"}

👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final-year PhD candidate at The University of Utah, expecting to graduate in June 2026, and **I'm open to work**.

📍 My research interests:
  - 🤖 **AI & LLM for Building**
  - ⚙️ **Physics-Informed Modeling**
  - 🏙 **Building Energy Modeling & Calibration**.

📌 I'm currently developing **auto-building energy modeling (ABEM) using LLMs** to improve **modeling accessibility & scalability**.

## 🖇 Open-Source Contributions
[EPlus-LLM](https://github.com/EPlus-LLM/Model): A large open-sourced LLM for auto-building energy modeling.

[Prompting LLMs for ABEM](https://github.com/Gangjiang1/Prompting-for-Auto-building-Modeling): A comprehensive guideline for prompt engineering of LLMs in building modeling.

## 🔬 Experience
🧪 As part of my PhD journey, I am working with Dr. Jianli Chen on NSF-funded projects focused on Building Energy Modeling, Calibration, Optimization, and AI Applications in Buildings.

🧫 During my Master’s degree, I collaborated with Dr. Zhe Tian on NSF-China projects related to Building Energy System Simulation and Building Fault Detection & Diagnosis.

✍️ I have completed internships at AWS, where I gained experience in data center design and operation, and at SUNAC, where I worked in real estate management.

## 🎉 News
📢 Mar. 2024 – I will speak at the ASHRAE Annual Conference in Indianapolis, Indiana.

📄 Mar. 2024 – My new research paper, "EPlus-LLM: A Large Language Model-Based Computing Platform for Automated Building Energy Modeling," has been published in Applied Energy.
